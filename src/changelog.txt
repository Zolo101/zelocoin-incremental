1.2 (31/08/2019)
+ Simple Prestige. Convert your coins into either Zinc or Zirconium for a zelocoin per second boost or to increase the max layer.
+ Favicon icon for the website.

* Right now zinc & zirconium is insanely OP, so 1.2.1 will balance them out & add more things to buy.

-- How prestiges work -----------------------------------

Each zinc gives you an 100% PER SECOND boost.
Zirconium can currently be used to Increase Max Layer, which allows for more zelocoins.

You need 1e10 zelocoins to obtain zinc.
You need 1e8 zelocoins PER SECOND to obtain zirconium. In order to gain the zinc/zirconium, you must prestige.

---------------------------------------------------------

* The CSS themes has now been seperated into files.
* Send me your themes and if they are good enough, i'll add them into the game!

* Tick() now works like it should, passing 1e309 should be worry free now, the next hard limit is now 1e9e15, which is a lot... (I think it's 1e9000000000000000)
