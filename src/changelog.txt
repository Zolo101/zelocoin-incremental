* Right now zinc & zirconium is insanely OP, so 1.2.1 will balance them out & add more things to buy.

-- How prestiges work -----------------------------------

Each zinc gives you an 100% PER SECOND boost.
Zirconium can currently be used to Increase Max Layer, which allows for more zelocoins.

You need 1e10 zelocoins to obtain zinc.
You need 1e8 zelocoins PER SECOND to obtain zirconium. In order to gain the zinc/zirconium, you must prestig.
