The achievement & layer scrollbar now changes color and shape depending on
theme. This uses experimental webkit stuff so this may or may not show in 
your browser. If you use Chrome or Firefox or Safari (any browser that uses webkit), chances are it will work.

Categories uses a CSS property called "backdrop-filter" which dims everything
behind you when you view a category. Unfortunely, this property is only supported
in Edge 17, Chrome 76 & Safari (ios & mac) 9. This means Firefox does not support this yet.
If you wanna know if your browser supports this, check https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter

IF YOU ARE ON SAFARI (ios), CHANCES ARE THE BUTTON TEXT ARE MOST LIKELY CLIPPED DUE TO HOW SAFARI
RENDERS THE BUTTONS. IF THIS HAPPENS, TRY CHROME.
